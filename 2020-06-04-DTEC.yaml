                      Consumers or their representatives may request that an Initial Fraud Alert or, if the consumer is a member of the military on active duty, an Active Duty Alert be placed on their credit file. The Initial Fraud Alert will remain on the credit file for one year (366 days); the Active Duty Alert will remain on file for twelve months. Equifax will return an “N”, “Q”, or “V”, as applicable, in the Header segment.
                      
                      A user receiving a report containing an Initial Fraud Alert or Active Duty Alert may not grant credit without first determining the identity of the person making the request. If the consumer has provided a telephone number, it will be returned in a second Consumer Narrative Statement segment or Alert Contact segment and must be used for identity verification purposes before granting credit.
