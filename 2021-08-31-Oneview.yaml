    # Promoting to UAT


    To successfully submit test transactions through your application in the UAT
    environment, a test member number is required.  You may use your existing
    Equifax test member number(s).  Please contact your Equifax Account
    Representative if a new test member number is needed. The steps below can be
    used to test in the UAT environment.


    Transactions generated using a test member number do not return identical
    results as a sandbox transaction.  A sandbox transaction will reflect
    everything that is exposed in the API whereas a test member number is
    configured to align with the specifications of your contract. Please contact
    us to ensure your test member number is configured to your expectations.

                  Contains contact information for the consumer when a Fraud or
                  Active Duty Alert is on the report. If the credit file
                  contains a Consumer Statement, the Alert Contact information
                  will follow the Consumer Statement on file. A Consumer
                  Statement may be returned regardless of a Fraud or Active Duty
                  Alert being on file (such as when a consumer is explaining
                  his/her circumstances for filing bankruptcy). The Consumer
                  Statement will continue to be returned on those consumer
                  reports.

                          Indicator is for identity fraud risk alert purposes
                          only and is not to be used for determining an
                          individual’s eligibility for any credit or any other
                          FCRA permissible purpose. Client shall use the
                          [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT]  exclusively within Client’s own
                          organization for the purpose of identity fraud
                          prevention.  Accordingly, Client will not use an alert
                          or warning message from the [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT]
                          system in its decision-making process for denying
                          credit, but will use the message as an indication that
                          the consumer's identity and personally identifiable
                          information should be independently verified to form a
                          reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of
                          the consumer. Client understands that the information
                          supplied by [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] may or may not apply
                          to the consumer who has applied to Client for credit,
                          service, dealings, or other financial transactions.
                          Client also understands and agrees that data from the
                          [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] system is proprietary to Equifax
                          and shall not be used as a component of any database
                          or file built or maintained by Client. The use of such
                          data shall be limited to the specific transaction for
                          which the [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] message is provided.
                          Equifax may, by written notice to Client, immediately
                          terminate the Client’s agreement for service or
                          suspend the [SYNTHETIC ID ALERT] service if Equifax
                          has a reasonable belief that Client has violated the
                          terms of this disclaimer or the agreement for service.
