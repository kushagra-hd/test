    # Introduction
    Credit Report API returns the latest credit report
    # Getting started
    1. Browse the specifications & evaluate against the Sandbox using our Postman collections.
    2. When you are ready for your own Test/UAT environment, initiate an Onboarding Request as explained in the Consumer Data Suite User Guide.
    3. Following the Security Standards and Authentication, you will get an Access Token from our OAuth endpoint using the JWT you created.
    4. Then enroll your consumer in the Consumer Data Suite platform and add product features to the enrollee identifier.
    5.  Finally, access the product APIs, fulfilling and delivering data to your consumers.
    
          Read more in our Consumer Data Suite User Guide under Additional API Docs.
