    # Introduction
    
    Automated Data View (ADV) is a service that enables customers to access their account information. By entering the consumer’s name, address, and social security number, the customer can verify their consumer’s account information as it appears in the Equifax files. Automated Data View can be used to measure the quality of the data in your accounts, thus enabling you to audit the way information is stored in the consumer file.
